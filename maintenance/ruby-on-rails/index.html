        <p>Does this sound familiar?</p>

        <p>
          By creating software, you've made a significant investment in your business.
          It might be your core business, something that compliments your business, or
          an internal tool to enable better business decisions. Whatever the case,
          launching is only the beginning. <i>It's the easy part.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          As time goes on, users will discover bugs that you weren't aware existed,
          they'll use the system in ways you didn't intend, and problems will surface.
          Additionally, the software upon which your system is built will get out of date,
          exposing your business to security issues that can be exploited and placing your
          users' information at risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sadly, this is not uncommon. Many web applications live in a state of perpetual
          abandonment.

        <p>
          You want to keep your web application working for your business, so what do you do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Have one of your existing employees maintain the application?</u>
          This is great if you already have developers, but it means shifting their time away
          from existing projects and deadlines. Most businesses aren't in a position to do this.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Hire a freelancer?</u>
          Most freelancers are expensive, with low availability, and typically look for larger,
          more lucrative projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Hire a full-time developer?</u>
          Even if you locate a good developer, is there enough work to keep them busy full time?

        <p>
          Currently, our Ruby on Rails Application Maintenance service is only
          <b>$1,000 / month for the first host, plus $250 / month for each
          additional host</b>. This price may change in the future, but you'll
          always pay the same rate you secured, for the duration of the engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also try us for a month. If you aren't satisfied, we'll refund
          your money and call it a day. Anything we did in that first month is yours
          to keep.
