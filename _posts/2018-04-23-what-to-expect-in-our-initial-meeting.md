title: "What Can I Expect From Our Initial Meeting?"
---

It's a question we get asked a lot. Before we start developing, there are a few things we like to ask to learn a bit more about your project.

### The Problem

<b>What problem are you trying to solve, and why? What business goals do you have in mind after you successfully execute this?</b>

We do more than just develop software, we act as consultants in your endeavor. The more information we have about your business goals, the better equipped we'll be to advise you on the best path to reach them.

### Budget

<b>Do you have a budget set aside for this project? And is it going to be sufficient to execute your idea?</b>

We strive to take on projects where we're an investment, and what we produce yields a return-on-investment for our clients. We'll briefly overview the monetary goals you have with this project so that we can determine whether the payoff will ultimately outweigh your costs.

### Timeframe

<b>When are you looking to get started on this project?</b>

In order to schedule your project with the appropriate resources, we need to have a handle on your timeframe. Do you have a hard deadline or a soft one? If we estimate an 8 week project, but you have 4 weeks until a major deadline, then we'll need to allocate more resources to the project.
