  Chris keeps telling me I should listen to more podcasts, but I
  keep putting it off. No more! I've made it a goal to create a
  wondorous playlist of epic proportions. Here's a podcast I found
  recently that kept my attention, was interesting and fit perfectly
  into my commute.

title: "Level Up With a New Podcast"
---

Velocity Labs partner, [Chris Irish][], is constantly listening to
podcasts and challenges/encourages us to listen as well. I took him
up on it recently, searched around and found a new one I really
enjoyed.

This podcast is called [Level Up][] and consists of interviews with
founders, investors and other people in the startup space. It explores
how they got started, challenges they faced, successes, failures and
some actionable advice.

There's a lot of good info packed into each episode, and it's short
enough (13-20 minutes) to keep your (er... _my_ ;) attention.

It started in February this year, so there are only 6 real episodes
in the playlist, but I listened to them in the span of 2 days. If
you're into that sort of thing, [give it a listen][].

Know of other good podcasts we should add to our playlists? Let us
know on twitter [@velocitylabs][].
