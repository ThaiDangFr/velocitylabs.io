title: "How Does Velocity Labs Work With Existing Projects?"
---

We often encounter clients who have already begun, or finished, developing their inital application. Some have a completed project that needs additional functionality to better service their customers. Some are partially complete and in need of assistance in order to launch to production.

<b>Whatever your case may be, we can help.</b>

<ol>
  <li>
    We'll want to schedule an initial phone meeting with you to discuss your project and expectations. Read more about
    <a href="/blog/2018/04/23/what-to-expect-in-our-initial-meeting">what to expect in our initial meeting</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    You have an existing project that's been touched by one or more developers, over time. We'll want to
    <a href="/blog/2018/04/30/why-do-i-need-a-code-review">review the existing code</a> to help us understand where you are currently.
  </li>

  <li>
    In order to accurately estimate the amount of work required, we
    <a href="/blog/2009/12/16/gathering-requirements-through-story-workshops">conduct a story workshop</a>. In this workshop, we'll gather the high-level requirements of your project. We will then use those requirements to provide a proposal and estimate.
  </li>

  <li>
    Once we've agreed on the scope of the project and the budget, we'll get started. Find out
    <a href="/blog/2018/05/07/what-is-a-typical-first-week-like">what a typical first week of development looks like</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Each day, you'll see progress on your project. We believe that
    <a href="/blog/2018/05/14/what-makes-a-successful-software-project">transparency and communication are the keys to a successful project</a>. We won't be working in a vacuum and you'll typically hear from us every day.
  </li>

  <li>
    As the project begins to wind down, you may want to enter a maintenance phase. We also offer continued monitoring and small changes through our
    <a href="/ruby-on-rails/maintenance">maintenance package</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

Whether you're in need of a new team, or just need to supplement your existing team, we have the experience to take on your existing project. <a href="/#contact">Contact us today!</a>
