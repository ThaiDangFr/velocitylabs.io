<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-AZ/events/xfjpvpyxjbzb/">
  Ruby::AZ is hosting a meetup on June 19th.
</a>
The Phoenix Ruby User group is a monthly meeting for Ruby enthusiasts in the Phoenix metropolitan area.

<blockquote>
  This month will feature several short talks on varying subjects, including how to install, execute, and interpret flame graphs, a recap of the Ruby for Good conference, and other topics.
</blockquote>

Come prepared to share something, if you want, or just sit back and hear what other Phoenix Rubyists are up to. And as always, be sure to say hi to Chris or Curtis if you see us there!
