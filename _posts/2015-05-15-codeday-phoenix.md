**CodeDay is coming to Phoenix again!** _And it's in our [favorite coworking space][] :)_

This event gathers students interested in coding and gives them
24 hours to go from idea to app. It's an intense, overnight event
that really challenges the attendees.

It's a great opportunity for students who already code to
flex those skills toward a goal, within a short timeframe. And if
you don't know how to code, no problem! You can learn the basics
of coding, meet new people and gain experience in a fun learning
environment.

I attended the demos at the end of the last code day in Phoenix and
was really impressed with the results the students achieved in such
a short timeframe. I'm looking forward to seeing what they'll come
up with this time!

If this sounds interesting to you, or your student, check it
out on the [CodeDay Phoenix website][] or [register for CodeDay][].

See you there!
