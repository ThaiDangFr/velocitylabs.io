Next week we'll be traveling as a company to RailsConf in Atlanta. It's
been a few years since I've been to one, but I'm really looking forward
to it. Beyond the opportunity to network and refresh our excitement about
Rails, we've been perusing the schedule and found some things that
piqued our interest!

### Rails 5

We know that the next version of Rails is coming up and RailsConf is
a great place to learn about, and get a sneak peek at, some of the
new features.

While there will probably be discussion in general about the next
version and DHH will probably talk about it in his keynote, we're
interested to hear more about
[how attributes and type casting will be changing](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1082)
as well as [how callbacks will be changing](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_849).

We always look forward to hearing about the progression and evolution
of the framework we love!

### Process

While it's not the most glamourous topic, process is an important
part of software development. As Velocity Labs has begun growing, we've
been evaluating and refining how we work.

Recently, we've defined some of our processes, including a branching
strategy, built-in code review cycle, continuous integration testing,
issue tracking and release deployment process.

In particular, the code review cycle is now an integral part of how we
work, but we know that there's always room for improvement. That's why
we're intrigued to learn how we can improve and
[implement a stronger code review culture](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1165),
from Derek Prior of thoughtbot.

### JavaScript + Rails

We figured JavaScript would be a hot topic this year and we weren't
disappointed. There are sessions on integrating some of the popular
frameworks like
[react.js on Rails](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_962) and the
[EmberCLI Rails gem](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_977).

There's also a session on
[using ECMAScript 6](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1223),
in your Rails app, which sounds very interesting.

And then, if you're tired of the JS framework hype, you can get a
side-by-side comparison of AngularJS, Ember.js and Rails server-side JS
to find out
[why your front-end framework is overkill](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_999).

If you're in Atlanta, hit us up during the conference or on Twitter
[@velocitylabs](https://twitter.com/velocitylabs)!
