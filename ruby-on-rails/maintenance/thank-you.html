          <li>Gather any supporting documentation you may have in regards to your application.</li>
          <li>Gather your 3rd party credentials (Github/Bitbucket, Heroku/AWS/Rackspace/Hosting provider, etc)
          </li>
          <li>Compile a list of your known bugs, we'll import them into a <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> board for your project.</li>
          <li>Compile a list of small tasks you need help with.</li>
          <li>Anything else you think will be helpful?  Let us know.</li>
