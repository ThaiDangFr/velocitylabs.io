        <p>Why should I bother?</p>

        <p>
          It's a good question to ask.  The main reasons are: <b><i>Security, Bug Fixes, Performance and EcoSystem updates</i></b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Security:</b> Just because you're not actively working on an app doesn't mean hackers aren't continuously searching for new vulnerabilities.  By staying up to date, or as closely as possible, you mitigate risk to your business and customer's data.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Bug Fixes:</b> All applications today are built upon many small libraries.  There are known bugs in pretty much every library, though they range in severity from insignificant annoyances to more critical issues.  By keeping Rails and your application's dependent gems up to date you benefit from the community's effort to keep these libraries as stable and secure for your app as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Performance:</b> Speed! Amazon calculated that 1 second longer in page load costs them $1.6 billion annually.  And with so many big websites using Ruby on Rails there is a large demand for speed.  This in turn results in many updates to the latest versions of Rails to improve performance.  Staying up to date allows you to take advantage of these new performance improvements
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>EcoSystem:</b> Ease of upgrades is important.  The older your version of Rails is, the harder it becomes to upgrade to newer versions later on.  The community moves forward but you don't.  And it will make it harder for future developers to work on, costing you more time & money down the road.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think of your application like a custom racecar.  If you want to win you'll need fresh tires, a tuned engine, and topped off gas tank.

        <p>
          The team at Velocity Labs has been working with Rails since 2007.
          This has provided us with many opportunities to upgrade both large and small applications.  We've seen alot.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we go through the code, here's what you can expect us to
          look at:

          Every application is different and we'll need to know some more info to know.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most Rails applications can be upgraded within a full week of development work.  But some things to consider are:
        </p>

        <ul class="complexity-considerations">
          <li>What version of Rails are you currently on? The older, the longer it will take.</li>
          <li>How much test coverage is there? The less there is, the longer it will take.</li>
          <li>How complex is the application?  The more complex, the longer it will take.</li>
          <li>How large is the application?  The more external dependencies, the longer it will take.</li>
