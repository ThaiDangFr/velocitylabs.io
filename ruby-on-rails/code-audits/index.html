        <p>
          By creating software, you've made a significant investment in your business.
          It might be your core business, something that compliments your business, or
          an internal tool to enable better business decisions. Whatever the case, do
          you have a clear understanding of what was built, <i>including it's limitations</i>?
        </p>

        <p>
          As time goes on, your users may be the ones to discover those limtations,
          severely affecting your bottom line. Catching problems as early as possible
          reduces the overall cost of the software and instills confidence that what
          was built will stand the test of time.
